!4 Test - Synchronous request/response with product (content based) routing
 * Sends {@link #FILE_PING_REQUEST_OK} synchronously with product {@link #PRODUCT_TEST_2} from {@link #ACTOR_AXEL} with no specified receiver.
 * The request should be routed to the destination {@link #ACTOR_REFERENCE} (by existence of an agreement).
 * The echo plugin will echo the input file as response.
